        <p>
          Nguyen Nguyen has worked for me as an intern Frontend / Fullstack
          developer since January 2020 and continued to work until 31st of
          August 2020. He helped with the implementation of a new section in our
          application and was responsible for several new features within the
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Nguyen joined Plannr.eu, he did not have any previous experience
          with some of the technologies he had to workin, but as a fast learner
          that isnâ€™t afraid of doing some extra self-study, he quickly gained
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>I highly recommend Nguyen as an entry-level fullstack developer.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Pieter Moeremans</p>
